# Contributing

I consider this guide to be mostly complete.  
But suggestions for fixes and improvements are always welcomed.  

- You can report trivial fixes like typo at [#1].
- Keep it absolutely minimal. This is not a comprehensive guide.

## Translating

Translation contributions are very appreciated!

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add translated version at `i18n/{lang}.md`.
3. Update translation list in `README.md`.
4. Commit changes & Create a PR.

- `{lang}` is [ISO 639-1] code of the language.
- Prefix translation commit messages with `translate({lang}):`.
- **Translations and the original must have same line count.**  
  (Each line in translation must correspond to each line in original)

[ISO 639-1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>
