How do I ask a good question? That is a great question!

## 1. Don't ask for help, Ask a question

- "Can anyone help me with~" (X)
- Just get straight to the question.

## 2. Describe the problem, Not your solution

- You have problem X, your solution Y failed.
- "How do I make Y work?" (X)
- "How do I solve X? I tried Y." (O)

## 3. "It doesn't work" just doesn't work

Every (programming) question should contain:
1. The Problem: Defined by expected I/O
2. The Code: Relevant context + optional full code. Ideally MRE.
3. The Error: Full error message, or the wrong output

## 4. Ask for what to Ask

- It's ok to be lost
- Try to fill out required information from #3
- Your first goal is to find out what you don't know
- "Where should I look?"

## 5. Don't be scared of Reading

- Read the Error
- Read the README
- Search the Web
