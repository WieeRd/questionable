# Questionable

> How do I ask a good question?

That is a great question!

## TL;DR (WIP)

```text
TODO: copypasta for answering stupid questions
```

## 1. Don't ask for help, Ask a question

> Can anyone help me with ABC?  
> Does anyone here use ABC?

You're wasting time. Just ask the question.  
Also, you should be looking for an answer, not a teacher.  
People might show you the way but will not give you a ride.

## 2. Describe the problem, Not your solution

You have problem X, your solution Y failed.

- "How do I make Y work?" (X)
- "How do I solve X? I tried Y." (O)

Often Y is wrong approach in the first place and will end up  
wasting both you and the answerer's time with confusion.  
Remember that your real goal is to solve X, not fixing Y.

## 3. Provide enough information

"It doesn't work" just doesn't work. Keep 3 things in mind:

- **Clarify the goal** in terms of expected input, output, and their relation.

- **Provide the code** to be inspected.  
  Extract the relevant part of the code to eliminate unnecessary details.
  Ideally, make the extracted part [executable by itself][MRE].

- **Explain what's wrong** with current behavior.  
  Get a sample output and compare it with the expectation.  
  If something crashes, provide *full* error message (not just the error code).

```text
I want my program to {expected output} upon {expected input}.
I tried {code example} and it produces {error | sample output}.
This was not expected because {reason}.
```

## 4. Ask for what to Ask (WIP)

- It's ok to be lost
- Try to fill out required information from #3
- Your first goal is to find out what you don't know
- "Where should I look?"

## 5. Extras (WIP)

- Try to READ
- Don't be sorry for asking, be thankful for answers
- Manners Maketh Man
