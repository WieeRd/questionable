# Questionable

> How do I ask a good question?

That is a great question!

## 1. Don't ask for help, Ask a question

> Can anyone help me with ABC?  
> Does anyone here use ABC?

You're wasting time. Just ask the question.  
Also, you should be looking for an answer, not a teacher.  
People might show you the way but will not give you a ride.

## 2. Describe the problem, Not your solution

You have problem X, your solution Y failed.

- "How do I make Y work?" (X)
- "How do I solve X? I tried Y." (O)

Often Y is wrong approach in the first place and ends up  
wasting both you and the answerer's time with confusion.  
Remember that your real goal is to solve X, not fixing Y.

## 3. Provide enough information

"It doesn't work" just doesn't work. Your question should contain:

```text
 Problem          Code           Error
┌────────┐  ┌───────────────┐  ┌────────┐
│ Input  │->│   Full Code   │  │ Error  │
└────────┘  │  ┌─────────┐  │->│────────│
┌────────┐  │  │ Context │  │  │ Wrong  │
│ Output │<-│  └─────────┘  │  │ Output │
└────────┘  └───────────────┘  └────────┘
```

### 3.1. The Problem

Most (if not all) problems can be described with:

- Expected input
- Expected output
- Their relation

### 3.2. The Code

Your attempted solution for the problem.

- Context: Relevant part of the code, to address the problem more quickly.
- Full: In case you missed something in the context, provide a link to the full code.

There is an ideal form of code sample, called *minimal reproducible example*.  
It can function as a context and a full code at the same time!

### 3.3. The Error

- Error: Provide **full** error message, not just the error name/code.
- Wrong Output: Give an example and explain it. What exactly is "not working"?

## 4. Ask for what to Ask

- It's ok to be lost
- Try to fill out required information from #3
- Your first goal is to find out what you don't know
- "Where should I look?"

## 5. Don't be scared of Reading

- Read your own question
- Read the Error
- Read the README
- Search the Web
