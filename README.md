# Questionable

> How do I ask a good question?

That is a great question!

## 1. Don't ask for help, Ask a question

> Can anyone help me with ABC?\
> Does anyone here use ABC?

You're wasting time. Just ask the question.\
Also, you should be looking for an answer, not a teacher.\
People might show you the way but will not give you a ride.

## 2. Describe the problem, Not your solution

You have problem X, your solution Y failed.

- "How do I make Y work?" (X)
- "How do I solve X? I tried Y." (O)

Often Y is wrong approach in the first place and ends up\
wasting both you and the answerer's time with confusion.\
Remember that your real goal is to solve X, not fixing Y.

## 3. "It doesn't work" just doesn't work

Every (programming) question should contain:

1. The Problem: Defined by expected I/O
2. The Code: Relevant context + optional full code. Ideally MRE.
3. The Error: Full error message, or the wrong output

## 4. Ask for what to Ask

- It's ok to be lost
- Try to fill out required information from #3
- Your first goal is to find out what you don't know
- "Where should I look?"

## 5. Don't be scared of Reading

- Read your own question
- Read the Error
- Read the README
- Search the Web
