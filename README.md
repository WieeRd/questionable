# Questionable

> How do I ask a good question?

That is a great question!

## TL;DR (WIP)

```text
TODO: copypasta for answering stupid questions
```

## 1. Don't ask for help, Ask a question

> Can anyone help me with ABC?  
> Does anyone here use ABC?

You're wasting time. Just ask the question.  
Also, you should be looking for an answer, not a teacher.  
People might show you the way but will not give you a ride.

## 2. Describe the problem, Not your solution

You have problem X, your solution Y failed.

- "How do I make Y work?" (X)
- "How do I solve X? I tried Y." (O)

Often Y is wrong approach in the first place and will end up  
wasting both you and the answerer's time with confusion.  
Remember that your real goal is to solve X, not fixing Y.

## 3. Provide enough information

"It doesn't work" just doesn't work. Your question should contain:

<!-- TODO: ascii diagram only works if using monospace font -->
```text
 Problem          Code           Error
┌────────┐  ┌───────────────┐  ┌────────┐
│ Input  │->│   Full Code   │  │ Error  │
└────────┘  │  ┌─────────┐  │->│────────│
┌────────┐  │  │ Context │  │  │ Wrong  │
│ Output │<-│  └─────────┘  │  │ Output │
└────────┘  └───────────────┘  └────────┘

How can I make the program {output} when I {input}?
I tried {context}, which is part of {link to full code}.
But then it {error}, which is wrong because {reason}.
```

### 3.1. The Problem

Every programming problem can be described with 3 parts:  
Expected **input**, **output**, and their **relation**.

### 3.2. The Code

- **Context**  
Only the relevant part of the code, to address the problem more quickly.

- **Full Code**  
Optional link to the full code, as something might be missing in the context.

- **Environment**  
External factors like software versions or OS can also affect the result.

An ideal form of code example is called *minimal reproducible example*.  
It can function as a context and a full code at the same time!

### 3.3. The Error

- **Error Message**  
Provide **full** error message, not just the error name/code.

- **Wrong Output**  
Provide an example and explain what's wrong. What exactly is "not working"?

## 4. Ask for what to Ask (WIP)

- It's ok to be lost
- Try to fill out required information from #3
- Your first goal is to find out what you don't know
- "Where should I look?"

## 5. Extras (WIP)

- Try to READ
- Don't be sorry for asking, be thankful for answers
- Manners Maketh Man
