> How do I ask a good question?

That is a great question!

## TL;DR (WIP)

Use this copypasta to answer every *questionable* questions.  
Please DO NOT omit the source when quoting this guide.

How do I ask a good question?

Problem: Lossless compression of natural language
Description: Summarize everything within 80C 24L
Status: Reducing down to 24L is harder than filling out 24 pages (send help)

## 1. Don't Ask For Help, Ask a Question

> Can anyone help me with ABC?  
> Is there anyone who uses ABC?

You're wasting time. Just ask the question.  
Moreover, you should be looking for an answer, not a teacher.  
People might show you the way but will not give you a ride.

## 2. Describe the Goal, not the Step

You have problem X, your solution Y failed.

- "How do I make Y work?" (X)
- "How do I solve X? I tried Y." (O)

Often Y is wrong approach in the first place and will end up  
wasting both you and the answerer's time with confusion.  
Remember that the real goal is to solve X, not fixing Y.

## 3. Provide Enough Information

"It doesn't work" just doesn't work. Keep these in mind:

- **Clarify the goal** in terms of expected input, output, and their relation.

- **Provide the code** to be inspected.  
  Extract the relevant part of the code to eliminate unnecessary details.  
  Ideally, make the extracted part [executable by itself][MRE].

- **Explain what's wrong** with current behavior.  
  Get a sample output and compare it with the expectation.  
  If something crashes, provide *full* error message (not just the error code).

```text
I want my program to {expected output} upon {expected input}.
I tried {code example} and it produces {error | sample output}.
This was not expected because {reason}.
```

## 4. Ask For What to Ask

You might be so clueless that you don't know where to even start.  
But don't be tempted to ask a bad question because of it.  
Instead, ask for a way to improve your question.

- **Ask for a way to gather more information.**  
  e.g. If a program freezes, ask for a way to check the logs.

- **Ask for learning materials.**  
  Don't dive straight to your abstract, ambiguous, and overambitious goal.  
  When it is clear you lack knowledge about the topic, you should learn.  
  e.g. How do I create my own Jarvis? â†’ What are some good resources for ML?

## 5. What Should be the Last Tip? (WIP)

- RTFM
- Informative title
- Grammar & Formatting (stop using screenshots)
- Manners Maketh Man
- "Sorry for the noob question"
- Extra Tips: Brief overview of everything above
